# React Resume
After years of having a good looking LaTex resume based on the design of Adrien Friggeri I decided to reverse engineer it in React to be more comfortable making the changes I wanted.

# Print to PDF
Once the resume is populated with your information you just need to open the "Print Dialog" and "Save as PDF".

# Setup

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
